# eCTF-Bad-Cryptography

## Description

This is a lab that shows bad implementations of cryptographic protocols used in the 2025 eCTF. 
The topic of the 2025 eCTF was creating an encoder and decoder for a satellite system.
So this lab is about 

**IMPORTANT**
So you are given encrypted frames from channel 1 and 2.
However, the provided decoder only has a valid subscription for channel 1!
To get the flag, you must be able to decrypt the channel 2 frames.
Break every level's designs by exploiting their misuse of cryptographic protocols!


*Notes to self*
NEED TO CREATE SLIDESHOW FOR EXPLAINING EVERYTHING
I think the lab should be an hour long? Actually let's do 1.25 hours
So presentation should take 10 minutes and then every level will take 10 minutes 
    (50 minutes)
Then presentation explaining how to crack every level and get feedback 
    (15 minutes)

## Flag Verfication

Windows

* https://www.shellhacks.com/windows-md5-sha256-checksum-built-in-utility/
* Maybe that?
* echo -n "foobar" | sha256sum
* Maybe this?
* certUtil -hashfile C:\file.img SHA256

Mac / Linux

* sha256sum -c Hash

## Level 0

This level is to make sure you're able to compare a hash to a plaintext. 
Like all levels, in the Hash file there's the computed sha256 hash and then to the right of that is the filename to compare this hash to. 
So if you were to try to compare the Hash to the Flag file currently, it should return something like:

    Flag: FAILED
    sha256sum: WARNING: 1 computed checksum did NOT match

Now do the line below:

    echo -n "flag{Harmadillo}" > Flag
It should be returning:

    Flag: OK

**All flags in this lab will be in the format "flag{something_in_here}" with no new line.**


## Prelude 
### Provided file information
Provided in every level (except level 0) is an 
**encoder.py**, **gen_secrets.py**, **decoder.c**, **decoder.h**, and **decoder.o**.

#### **gen_secrets.py**

gen_secrets.py is used to generate a random key for the system that the encoder and decoder use. 
To generate a secrets file:

    python gen_secrets.py file_name [channels] 
Example:

    python gen_secrets.py secrets 1 2 
From this example you should have a file named *secrets* that you can use with the encoder in the folder!


#### **encoder.py**

encoder.py
To use the encoder you need to give it a secrets file generated from the gen_secrets.py provided in the same folder.
encoder.py format is:

    python encoder.py secrets_file channel frame_data timestamp

Example:

    python encoder.py secrets 1 "NO FLAG ON THIS CHANNEL" 0



#### **decoder.c** and **h**

decoder.c and decoder.h are provided just so that you can see how the decoder.o is implemented since we don't want security by obscurity! Also, to make these files work without a board, I've taken some creative liberties to adjust them BUT the changes made have no impact on the initial design of the encryption algorithm. 

#### **decoder.o**

**WARNING**: You can probably just object dump this file to get information BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT TO DO IT. The point of this lab is to think of cryptographic vulnerabilities and exploit them, not my inability to encrypt object files ðŸ˜¢.

decoder.o simulates a working decoder that has a valid subscription to channel_1. To use decoder.o you have to give it a file with encrypted frames that are separated by new lines:

In case you have to make it an executable:

    chmod +x decoder.o

To use decoder.o:

    ./decoder.o file_with_encrypted_frames

Example:

    ./decoder.o CHANNEL_1
